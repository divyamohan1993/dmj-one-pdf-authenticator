# Contributing to dmj-one PDF Authenticator

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We welcome issues, feature requests, and pull requests.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository and clone it locally.
2. Install dependencies (requires Node.js and Wrangler) and set up a Cloudflare account.
3. Follow the deployment instructions in the [README.md](../README.md) or [QUICKSTART.md](../QUICKSTART.md) to run the Worker and signer service locally.
4. For the Java signer service, ensure you have Java 21 and Maven installed.

### Quick Setup for Development

For automated deployment on a VM:
```bash
# Follow the one-click deployment guide
# See one-click-deployment/readme.md
```

For local development:
```bash
# See DEVELOPMENT.md for detailed local setup instructions

## Submitting an Issue

- Use the **Bug report** or **Feature request** issue templates provided.
- Provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and relevant logs or screenshots.

## Pull Requests

- Make sure there is an issue that describes the problem or feature you're addressing.
- Create a new branch from `main` for your work.
- Write clear, concise commit messages that explain the reason for the change.
- Run all tests and linters before submitting your PR.
- Update documentation and examples as needed.
- Reference the issue number in the PR description (e.g., "Closes #12").

## Coding Style

- TypeScript code should follow the existing lint rules (we use ESLint and Prettier). Use consistent formatting and type annotations.
- Java code should follow standard formatting (the Google Java Style is a good starting point).
- Bash scripts should be POSIX compliant and include a shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env bash`).

## Testing

- Test Worker changes locally with `wrangler dev`
- Test Java signer changes with `mvn test`
- Run shell script tests with `shellcheck` if available
- Verify deployment scripts in a clean VM environment when possible

## Documentation

When making changes, please update:
- Inline code comments for complex logic
- README.md for user-facing changes
- ARCHITECTURE.md for architectural changes
- QUICKSTART.md for deployment process changes
- API documentation in relevant files
